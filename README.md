# verscan

verscan is a tool for evaluating your currently installed PHP version and checking it against known CVEs and the versions they were fixed in to report back potential issues.

PLEASE NOTE: Work is still in progress to adapt the tool to linux distributions that backport security fixes. As of right now, this only reports back for the straight up version reported.
